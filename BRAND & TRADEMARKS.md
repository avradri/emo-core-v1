# BRAND & TRADEMARKS

> **Non‑legal note**  
> This document describes how the EMO brand should be used in practice.  
> It does *not* replace legal advice. For anything binding, please consult a qualified lawyer.

## 1. What is EMO?

**EMO (Emergent Mind Observatory)** is:

- A set of metrics for planetary‑scale cognition and cooperation (e.g. organismality, synergy, global workspace ignition, self‑model fidelity, UIA).
- A reference implementation of those metrics (this repository, “EMO‑Core”).
- A growing ecosystem of tools, data pipelines, and dashboards that make these metrics usable in real systems (digital twins, early warning systems, governance labs, etc.).

The source code in this repository is made available under a **dual MIT / Apache 2.0 license**.  
The **brand** (“EMO”, “Emergent Mind Observatory”, logos, visual identity) is **separate** from the code.

## 2. Brand ownership

Unless otherwise indicated, the following are trademarks or brand identifiers of the EMO project:

- **“EMO”**
- **“Emergent Mind Observatory”**
- The EMO logo(s) and visual identity (where provided)

Use of the code under the MIT and/or Apache 2.0 licenses does **not** by itself grant any rights to use the EMO name, logos, or other brand elements as if your project were the official EMO project.

> This section is intentionally general. Exact legal ownership and registration details may depend on jurisdiction and should be confirmed with legal counsel.

## 3. Using the EMO name in your project

We encourage integration, collaboration, and reuse. To keep the ecosystem coherent and avoid confusion, please follow these guidelines when referring to EMO:

### 3.1 Acceptable references

You **may** describe your use of EMO like this, provided the statements are true:

- “Built with **EMO‑Core**.”
- “Powered by **EMO** metrics.”
- “Uses the open‑source **EMO‑Core** implementation.”
- “Based on the **Emergent Mind Observatory (EMO)** framework.”

If your project is a fork or reimplementation that still follows the EMO specification and passes the official tests (once available), you may describe it as:

- “An EMO‑compatible implementation.”
- “A system built on the EMO framework.”

### 3.2 Things you should not do

Please **do not**:

- Present your project as the **“official”** EMO project, unless you are part of the core team.
- Use the EMO logo, wordmark, or visual identity in a way that suggests official endorsement or authorship without written permission.
- Name your product in a way that is likely to confuse users, such as:
  - “Official EMO Suite”
  - “EMO Enterprise Edition”
  - “EMO by \<Your Org\>”
- Heavily modify the core definitions of EMO metrics while still presenting them as **“EMO v1.x”** without clearly indicating deviations from the reference definitions.

If in doubt, use language such as:

- “Fork of EMO‑Core”
- “Derived from EMO‑Core”
- “Inspired by EMO”

## 4. Naming forks and derivative projects

If you create a fork or derivative project:

- Please choose a name that is distinct from **“EMO”** and **“Emergent Mind Observatory.”**
- You are encouraged to acknowledge the origin, for example:
  - “\<ProjectName\>, based on EMO‑Core”
  - “\<ProjectName\>, a fork of Emergent Mind Observatory (EMO)”

This helps avoid confusion about which implementation is the canonical reference and which is experimental, proprietary, or heavily modified.

## 5. “EMO‑Compatible” and “EMO‑Certified” (planned)

We plan to define two optional labels for ecosystem projects:

- **EMO‑Compatible**  
  A project that:
  - Implements the EMO v1.x metric definitions faithfully, and
  - Passes an open conformance test suite provided by the EMO team.

- **EMO‑Certified**  
  A project, deployment, or service that:
  - Passes the EMO‑Compatible tests, **and**
  - Has been reviewed and explicitly approved by the EMO core team or designated stewards.

Until these programs are formally launched and documented, please do not describe your project as **“EMO‑Certified”**. When in doubt, “based on EMO‑Core” or “EMO‑compatible” is usually accurate and sufficient.

## 6. Relationship to the open‑source licenses

The **code** in this repository is licensed under a dual MIT / Apache 2.0 license.  
In short, this means (in non‑legal language):

- You may use, modify, and distribute the code, including in commercial and proprietary systems, subject to the conditions of the chosen license.
- You must respect the attribution and notice requirements of the license you choose.
- No warranty is provided.

The **brand** (names, logos, marks) is governed by **this document and applicable trademark law**, not by the MIT or Apache 2.0 licenses.

This document does not grant you any trademark rights; it simply explains how we ask you to use the EMO brand when referring to this project.

## 7. Contact

For questions about:

- Using the EMO name or logo in your project
- Press, talks, and collaborations
- Formal EMO‑Compatible / EMO‑Certified status (once available)

We are generally enthusiastic about responsible reuse and integration.  
If you’re building something aligned with EMO’s goals, we want to hear from you.
