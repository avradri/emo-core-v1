## 1. Excellence

### 1.1 Objectives

**Overall objective**

To develop, deploy and operate the **Emergent Mind Observatory (EMO)** as a **continuous, open, planetary‑scale cognitive observatory**, providing a *standard cognitive layer* above digital Earth twins, planetary boundary dashboards and global early warning systems.

EMO treats humanity plus its infrastructures as an **emergent mind** and measures:

- Organismality (OI) – coherence vs fragmentation of global cooperation.  
- Synergy / O information (SΦ / Ω) – integrative vs redundant information processing across media, science and policy.  
- Global Workspace Ignition (GWI) – when global attention “lights up” around risks and opportunities.  
- Self‑Model Fidelity (SMF) – whether self‑models (e.g. 1.5 °C pathways) actually steer emissions, budgets and infrastructure.  
- Information time (τ_I) – the rate of validated predictive capacity across domains.  
- Reciprocity fluxes and UIA density _a_UIA_ – a universal action density for the “Humanity ↔ Earth” interface.   

**Specific objectives (O1–O6)**

- **O1 – EMO Core Engine:**  
  Implement an open‑source EMO core computing OI, SΦ, GWI, SMF and τ_I from harmonised global data streams, with documented APIs and reference datasets.

- **O2 – UIA Engine & Cognitive Health Indicator:**  
  Operationalise the UIA framework for the human–Earth interface by estimating 𝓡[g_I], ℬ, C(t), S(t), I(t) and M_E/M₀, and combine these with EMO metrics into a dimensionless cognitive health indicator _a_UIA_ and UIA bands (healthy/unstable/pathological). :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}  

- **O3 – Dual Twin Integration with Digital Earth Twins (DestinE):**  
  Integrate EMO with at least two DestinE thematic digital twins (Climate Adaptation, Weather‑Induced Extremes) as a **dual‑twin layer** providing cognitive overlays for scenarios and simulations. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}  

- **O4 – Early Warning Cognition Index (EWCI):**  
  Develop an Early Warning Cognition Index that quantifies cognitive coverage, ignition, latency and self‑model fidelity in the global early warning system (EW4All, WMO, UNDRR).

- **O5 – Planetary Boundaries & Planetary Health UIA Mapping:**  
  Embed planetary boundary and planetary health indicators into the EMO/UIA ledger, relating exosomatic energy and info‑system investments to boundary retreat/overshoot and semantic efficiency M_E.

- **O6 – Open Observational Infrastructure & Governance:**  
  Run EMO as a continuous observatory with open data products, public dashboards, a polycentric governance structure and clear ethics guidelines, aligning with Horizon Europe’s “Excellent Science” pillar and Research Infrastructures objectives. :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}

### 1.2 Relation to the work programme

**Horizon Europe context**

Horizon Europe is structured into three pillars and one horizontal part; the **Excellent Science** pillar supports frontier research, researcher mobility and world‑class research infrastructures. :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}  

EMO is primarily aligned with:

- **Pillar I – Excellent Science / Research Infrastructures**:  
  EMO is a *virtual, distributed research infrastructure* providing standardised cognitive metrics and UIA‑based indicators that can be consumed by many projects (digital twins, risk platforms, AI governance initiatives).

- **Pillar I – European Research Council (ERC)** (frontier research action):  
  The UIA/EMO theory programme constitutes a frontier research agenda in information geometry, complex systems and planetary cognition, suitable for a PI‑driven ERC grant (see Annex). :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}  

- **Potential links to Pillar II – Global Challenges & European Industrial Competitiveness:**  
  EMO contributes cross‑cutting indicators for clusters such as “Climate, Energy and Mobility” and “Health”, providing decision‑relevant cognitive metrics over multiple missions. :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}  

**European added value**

- Anchors a *uniquely European* dual‑twin framework (DestinE × EMO) at the heart of the global digital Earth ecosystem. :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}  
- Strengthens EU leadership in research infrastructures that connect Earth system science, complex systems and AI governance.

### 1.3 Concept and methodology

**Concept: EMO as a UIA‑based reciprocity ledger**

The project builds on the EMO and UIA preprints, which introduce:

- EMO as an **emergent‑mind observatory** measuring organismality, synergy, ignition, self‑model fidelity, information‑time and reciprocity fluxes at species scale. :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}  
- UIA (Universal Interface Action) as a **universal functional for interfaces** of complex systems, combining information geometry (𝓡[g_I]), focusing dynamics (ℬ), coherence, entropy and information flows, and semantic efficiency into a single action density. :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}  

EMO v1.0 applies UIA to the “Humanity ↔ Earth” interface, turning it into an **operational, data‑driven ledger**:

- **Interfaces Σ_i:** Earth system twins, early warning infrastructures, knowledge graphs, economic and trade networks, health systems, AI systems.  
- **Observables:** hazard fields, emissions, treaty events, attention streams, forecast skill, infrastructure investments, boundary indicators.  
- **Reciprocity flows:** exosomatic buffering vs environmental selection, cognitive amplification vs overload.  

**Methodological pillars**

1. **Metric stack (EMO metrics)**  
   - OI: logistic transforms of cooperation vs conflict indicators.  
   - SΦ / Ω: Gaussian O‑information across multi‑stream time series (news, science, conflict, policy).  
   - GWI: percentile‑based ignition detection across attention/memory streams.  
   - SMF: overlap and causal coupling between self‑model trajectories (e.g. emissions pathways) and realised trajectories.  
   - τ_I: cumulative validated forecast skill improvements across domains. :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}  

2. **UIA mapping**  
   - **𝓡[g_I]** from statistical manifolds fitted to climate, economic and epidemiological model ensembles via information geometry.  
   - **ℬ** from coarse‑grained circulation equations on global flows (energy, finance, mobility, hazard propagation).  
   - **C(t)** from GWI and cross‑stream coherence.  
   - **S(t)** from the dispersion of boundary and risk indicators.  
   - **I(t)** from τ_I and knowledge graph growth.  
   - **M_E/M₀** from risk‑reduction and boundary retreat per joule of exosomatic energy.

3. **Layered architecture** :contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}  
   - **Interface Registry (IR)** – catalogue of Σ_i interfaces and their UIA roles.  
   - **Data Ingestion & Harmonisation (DIH)** – pipelines for OWID, GDELT, Wikipedia, OpenAlex, forecast skill, DestinE outputs.  
   - **Reciprocity & UIA Engine (RUE)** – numerical estimation of UIA terms.  
   - **Species‑Mind & Planetary Health Layer (SCL)** – computation and interpretation of EMO metrics and planetary health interactions.  
   - **Interface & Governance Layer (IDL)** – APIs, dashboards, and governance processes.

4. **Dual‑twin methodology with DestinE**

   - Use DestinE Data Lake & HDA STAC endpoints to discover and retrieve twin outputs. :contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}  
   - Summarise high‑dimensional hazard fields into compact statistics (means, quantiles, trends) per scenario.  
   - Attach EMO metrics and UIA diagnostics to each scenario, forming a **cognitive overlay**.

5. **Early warning and planetary boundary methodology**

   - Collect early warning coverage, lead times, and impact data per hazard and region.  
   - Quantify ignition rates, latencies, and SMF for warnings.  
   - Integrate planetary boundaries and planetary health indicators as S(t) components in the UIA ledger.   

---

### 1.4 Ambition

**State of the art**

- Digital Earth twins and Research Infrastructures in Europe provide high‑fidelity physical and socio‑economic simulations but lack a unified cognitive diagnostic layer. :contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}  
- Planetary boundary and planetary health frameworks quantify biophysical safety and justice but not species‑level cognition. :contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}  
- Early warning programmes track coverage and some performance indicators but not the full cognition pipeline (warning → attention → decision → infrastructure).  

**Innovation**

- **First planetary‑scale cognitive observatory:** EMO is the first system to treat humanity as an emergent mind with explicit, operational metrics.   
- **Universal Interface Action at planetary scale:** UIA has been theorised; EMO provides its first implementation on real data at the scale of civilisation. :contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}  
- **Dual twin framework:** a genuinely new design pattern where digital Earth twins are paired with cognitive twins.  
- **Early Warning Cognition Index (EWCI):** extends physical early‑warning coverage metrics with cognitive performance and latency.  
- **Semantic efficiency benchmarking:** M_E/M₀ as a “meaning per joule” metric for planetary stewardship and AI‑assisted governance.

## 2. Impact

### 2.1 Pathways towards impact

**Scientific impact**

- Establish EMO as a **reference research infrastructure** for planetary cognition, used by Earth system scientists, complex systems researchers, and AI alignment labs.  
- Advance the foundations of information geometry, non‑equilibrium thermodynamics and complex systems via the UIA framework and its falsifiable predictions. :contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}  

**Policy and governance impact**

- Provide decision makers with **species‑mind vital signs**: OI, SMF, τ_I and _a_UIA_ time series that can be tracked alongside emissions and GDP.  
- Enable **cognitive KPIs** for digital twins, early warning systems, and AI governance frameworks (e.g. “did this investment move us into a healthier UIA band?”).

**Societal impact**

- Improve global ability to anticipate and respond to compound crises by identifying regions, hazards and domains where cognition is failing (e.g. high hazard, low ignition, low SMF).  
- Support just and inclusive transitions by exposing cognitive inequities across regions and populations (e.g. high early warning coverage but low trust and uptake).

---

### 2.2 Measures to maximise impact

**Open observatory**

## Annex – ERC‑style frontier research synopsis (for UIA/EMO theory core)

> This annex sketches the **scientific core** of EMO as a potential ERC frontier research project, where scientific excellence is the sole criterion. The ERC proposal would be PI‑led and focus on fundamental theory and methodology, while EMO as a Horizon Europe RI focuses on infrastructure and integration. :contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}  

### A1. Ground‑breaking nature and objectives

The proposed ERC‑class research programme aims to:

1. **Establish UIA as a universal field theory of interfaces** across scales, from bench‑top Ξ‑light experiments and cellular regulation through brains and AI systems all the way to planetary‑scale cognition. :contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}  

2. **Derive falsifiable predictions** relating curvature, focusing, coherence, entropy production and semantic efficiency to observable “vital signs” in complex systems.

3. **Test UIA universality** by:

   - Comparing UIA terms and EMO metrics for the human–Earth interface with analogous measurements in smaller‑scale systems (e.g., neural networks, biological regulatory networks, physical experiments).  
   - Identifying universality classes of cognitive interfaces.

4. **Develop a rigorous theory of “information time” (τ_I)** as an invariant across systems with very different physical time scales, and test it from laboratory to planet.

### A2. Approach

- Develop the mathematical structure of UIA (manifolds of models, curvature functionals, focusing flows, action principles). :contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}  
- Build **UIA‑aware probes** in laboratory systems (physical, biological, and AI) to estimate key terms experimentally.  
- Use EMO as a planetary‑scale laboratory for UIA, applying the same methods to the human–Earth interface.  
- Combine theory, simulation, and data‑driven estimation to test UIA predictions across scales.

### A3. Ambition and potential impact

- Provide a **unifying language** for cognition, control and stewardship that connects neuroscience, AI, biophysics and planetary governance.  
- Create new mathematical tools for information geometry and non‑equilibrium thermodynamics with potential impact far beyond EMO.  
- Inform the design of **safer AI systems and governance architectures** by grounding them in universal interface principles rather than ad‑hoc metrics.

This ERC‑style frontier research agenda is synergistic with the Horizon Europe EMO infrastructure: the ERC grant deepens the theory; EMO provides a unique planetary‑scale test bed.
